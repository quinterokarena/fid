<body>
<p>Hello! My name is Karena Quintero, and I am a sophomore at SSC. I am currently studying to get my AA in Digital Media and Visual Design. I am 19 years old and currently work at Target as a style team member. My job allows me to express my interest in visual merchandising as I am interested in being promoted to a VM team lead (visual merchandising.) I am a hard working, creative individual who is focused on thinking "outside of the box" to discover and create new and effective strategies to best fit any project I am assigned to, whether it may be in classs or at work. In previous years in highschool I was the editor-in-chief of my schools' yearbook program for three years, attended multiple CSPA conventions including the CSPA convention held in New York City, where I was able to take senior design classes at Columbia University and meet with many other students who felt the same passion and dedication to design as I did. I also was the EIC for my senior newsmagazine and newspaper.</p>
